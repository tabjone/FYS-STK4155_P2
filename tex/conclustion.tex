\section{Conclusion}


% Possible directions and future improvements?
% NN classification
% * should have controlled random events better, such as: 
%   * initialziation of weights, biases 
%   * selection of minibatces
% Not sure how this affected the results and if the small variations in some
% parameters can be attributed to random events
