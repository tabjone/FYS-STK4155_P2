\begin{comment}
State your main findings and interpretations. 
Try as far as possible to present perspectives for future work. 
Try to discuss the pros and cons of the methods and possible improvements.

Main findings:
    gradient methods: 

    Neural network regression:

    Classifiction:


Perspectives for future work:
    ...

Pros/Cons of methods and possible improvments:
Was the models used good? What worked and what didn't?
    gradient methods: 
        adam optimizer, not good for not noisy data, slow convergence

    neural network regression:
        

    classification:
        use of sigmoid activation for output in classification. Could be replaced
        by softmax for classifying non-binary problems.

% Possible directions and future improvements?
% NN classification
% * should have controlled random events better, such as: 
%   * initialziation of weights, biases 
%   * selection of minibatces
% Not sure how this affected the results and if the small variations in some
% parameters can be attributed to random events
