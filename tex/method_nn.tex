% Multi-layer perception aka. dense neural network


\subsection{Neural network}
{
    %General info of neural network
    % About artificial neurons ect.
    % We use feed-forward neural network, spesifically multi-layer perception,
    % or dense neural network (every neuron in layer connected with every
    % neuron in next and previous)


}
\subsubsection{Initialization}
% Weights and biases

\subsubsection{Feed-forward}
% Maybe activation functions before this since we use them here.

\subsubsection{Back propagation}
%Delta thing error

\subsubsection{Activation functions}
%
\textbf{Sigmoid}
%
\textbf{ReLU}
%
\textbf{Leaky ReLU}
%
\textbf{Softmax}
%
\textbf{Hyperbolic tangent}
%
\subsubsection{Training and evaluation}
% Idk
